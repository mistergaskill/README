Disclaimer: this is my best effort at introspection. If I've earned your trust please let me know where I can improve my self-awareness.

#### a human
- I'm a visual learner. Please show me a picture or a graph.
- I assume positive intent.
- I hate seeing well-meaning people cause harm to others.
- I seek incremental improvement but also try to appreciate things as they are.
- I am open to being proven wrong and don't suffer those who aren't.

#### an engineer
- I want to solve problems with code even if the code itself is boring.
- I love to write terse code... and then refactor it until it is readable.
- I love building for the web.

#### a leader
- I meet people where they're at.
- I embrace and (sometimes reluctantly) encourage healthy conflict.
- I expect teammates to support each other.
- I (try to) follow the principles of extreme ownership.
